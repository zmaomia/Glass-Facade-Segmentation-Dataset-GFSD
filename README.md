GFSD contains 356 oblique aerial images and 44 ground view images. To the best of our knowledge, GFSD is the first dataset specifically for glass facade segmentation in oblique aerial images and can be a supplement for aerial image segmentation tasks.

Three kinds of annotations are provided, including:

(1) Folder "mask" contains the mask of the glass facade.
(2) Folder "linemask" contains the edge annotation.
(3) The ".json" files contains glass panel information for instance segmentation.
